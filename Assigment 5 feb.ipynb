    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows us to create a new class by deriving the characteristics of an existing class. The new class is called the \"subclass\" or \"derived class,\" and the existing class is called the \"base class\" or \"parent class.\" The subclass inherits the attributes and methods of the base class, and can also add new attributes and methods or override the ones inherited from the base class.\n",

    "        self.name = name\n",
